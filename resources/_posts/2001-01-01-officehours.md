GitHub offers free, short, topical online classes about GitHub, Git, and the union of these two technologies. Every few events, we rotate through the series and each month we try introduce new topics into the mix. Covered topics include things such as [Pull Requests](https://github.com/blog/712-pull-requests-2-0), [Organizations](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations), GitHub:Enterprise, [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation), and the [GitHub API](http://developer.github.com/).
