Hi! Welcome to the Git and GitHub Foundations Class on XXXDAY, XXXMONTH XXnd.

We're glad you've decided to take a class with [GitHub:Training](http://github.com/training). This is just a quick reminder of the structure of the class and a confirmation that you have the resources in-hand to make the most of it.


## Webinar Sign-in Codes
If you have more than one person attending from your company, we would be very grateful if you can do a quick hallway check with your colleagues and ensure they have received a unique GoToWebinar welcome email that gives a sign in code and dial-in bridge for the class.

Please have your colleagues sign up for each of the two half-days at the URLs below so they have unique sign-in codes by which we can better interact with them by name during the class.

* [XXXThu, XXXSep XXX20, XXX2012 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM MDT](https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/XXX)
* [XXXFri, XXXSep XXX21, XXX2012 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM MDT](https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/XXX)


## Timing
Class is scheduled to begin at 09:00 AM [USA Mountain Time](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/mountain-time/) and run for three hours each day, inclusive of a short break.


## Preparation
In preparation for the class:

1. Verify GoToWebinar Requirements  
Verify your Mac or Windows computer meets the [basic requirements](http://support.citrixonline.com/en_US/GoToWebinar/help_files/GTW110003?title=Test+Your+GoToWebinar+Connection%7D).

2. Have an Audio Setup or Dial-in Capability  
You'll want to have a PC headset, or alternatively, are able to dial in to the conference bridge line. The dial-in number is displayed when you sign in to the webinar from your computer.

3. Read and review the course [pre-requisites page](/articles/github-class-prerequisites/).
This will ensure you've got Git up and ready to go for our interactive portions of the class.

4. Arrive a Few Minutes Early  
On class day, please sign in 15 minutes before the scheduled class start time.  We can test audio and make sure everything's perfect for the session to start on time.
