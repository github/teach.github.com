# Overview
RevealJS provides GitHub training materials and presentations with an easily-editable, markdown-ready format.

Assets and external resource dependencies are kept at the root of the presentations directory, while single HTML pages for each presentation are sub-foldered.

# Important Notes
This is an initial preview. Actual implementation of Markdown-based slides will utilize Jekyll and `includes` template to eliminate the griminess of hand-HTML-coded slides. Coming soon.
