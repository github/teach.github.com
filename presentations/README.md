# HydeSlides
* Slide markdown can be in root of _posts or folderized for ease of organization
* YAML front matter must include a  `tags: [tagname]`, typically matching the folder which contains the markdown files
* Including a `chapter` field in YAML front matter auto-injects a chapter cover page. To leave the cover page off, set `chapter: ''`
* SASS theming is found under `/dependencies`

## To Do
*[] Download Google Fonts for offline slide use
*[] Simplify layouts.scss styles
