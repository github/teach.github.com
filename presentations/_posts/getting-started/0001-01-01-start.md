Git is open source, which means it is on level footing with respect to openness to Subversion and CVS.

But from an engineering standpoint, there is a great deal more to say about Git. It takes some radical left turns from that of Subversion and CVS. In fact, from almost any other version control system.

You might be thinking from what you've heard in the tech news sphere that it is just a better Subversion. I'd counsel you to not that way about it at all. In fact, I'd like you to set aside any such expectations and be ready for what an entire reboot of VCS tooling might mean.
