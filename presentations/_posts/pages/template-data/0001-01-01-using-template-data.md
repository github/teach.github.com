* In addition to layouts, Jekyll also provides some more advanced template features
* Any field in the YML front matter can be displayed in the page using the format of <br /><code>&#123;{ page.property }}</code> where property is the value before the colon
* This helps to further separate the page's layout from information about the page
* You can also add YAML to a file named `_config.yml`, and it will be available to all templates as <code>&#123;{ site.key }}</code> using the same format
