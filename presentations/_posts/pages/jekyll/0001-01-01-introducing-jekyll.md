In addition to static file hosting, special files are transparently run through a powerful yet simple templating engine named [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) after every push to GitHub.

Because Jekyll sites are ultimately stored as static files, they are incredibly fast and scale very well.

Jekyll allows you to style pages with [reusable templates](TODO). This template-driven approach helps you to build larger sites in a very manageable way.
