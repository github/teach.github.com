# Help Us Improve These Materials

We're always looking for contributions to help improve these materials. If you have corrections, polish, or materials contributions, please submit them via a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). 

If your contribution is larger than a syntax fix or sentence re-wording, please initiate a discussion via a new Issue (type `c` after switching focus to the [Issues](https://github.com/github/teach.github.com/issues) tab) so we can help guide your contribution to the right location in the materials.
