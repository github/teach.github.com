## Dates for other VCSes
There have been a plethora of VCSes over the years. All seem like an incremental improvement over the previous model.

* SCCS
* RCS
* PVCS
* CVS, 1980s
* SVN, 1990s
* Git, 2005

Some firms think SVN is the thing to move to. But would you use a Palm Pilot today? Then why are you using CVS or SVN? They are roughly the same age!

We also need to be conservative in our choice of tools. We don't want to use something that is going to fade away next year. But Git isn't new by technology by any stretch. It is over 5 years old now.
