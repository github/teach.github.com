Any team or organization using Git as their version control system has a reponsibility to stay current with the bug fixes, enhancements and adjustments made in the ongoing releases. The way to stay current with these is to subscribe to the [Git Mailing List](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitCommunity) or browse the recent [Release Notes](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation/RelNotes).
