## Git-converted Projects
* [Apache (select project only, read-only mode)](http://git.apache.org/)
* 1.3 million projects at [GitHub](http://github.com)
* Android
* Perl
* Grails
* Hibernate

# Scalability
* Linux kernel averaging 2-4 changes per hour continuously for the last 4 years
* Have used with repos up to 2.4 GB in size, but that's on the large size
* `git gc` on an 8GB project is quite slow
* Modularization of your project is key (submodules)
* A multi-GB file can cause Git to run out of memory while commiting it.
