## Aliases
Commands can be composed and renamed in Git to better suit your working style. For example, I've renamed `git status` to `git s` and I've composed `git log --oneline --decorate` to `git logod`.

The configuration lives in a file in your home directory called `.gitconfig`.

Alias can be set up in section like the following in the `.gitconfig` file:

    [alias]
      br = branch
      bra = branch -a
      s = status
      cl = clone
      ci = commit
      co = checkout
      d = diff
      dw = diff --word-diff
      dh = diff HEAD
      dc = diff --cached
      who = shortlog -s --
      ph = push
      pl = pull
      lg = log -p
      lgod = log --oneline --decorate

Let's discuss some of these shortcuts and try them out in our own.

Aliases can also be added via the config command, but find this to be less efficient than editing the `~/.gitconfig` file directly.

    git config â€“-global alias.who shortlog -s --
    
Aliases only allow for Git commands by default, but you can coax it to run shell commands by prefixing the alias with an exclamation `!`.

    dm = !git diff | mate
    dv = !git diff | vim
    publish = !git checkout master && git pull && git checkout dev && git rebase master && git checkout master && git lgod

The `publish` command comes from the [ideas of Justin French](http://justinfrench.com/notebook/git-aliases-rock).
