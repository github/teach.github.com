# Fixing Mistakes

## Amend
Oops. You *just* committed something with a bad message or the wrong files. Redo a recent commit's file changes or comment. Get the file system in the state you want it before issuing this command.

    git commit --amend

or if you missed a few files that weren't in the last commit

    git commit -a --amend

or if you need to remove a file that wasn't supposed to be in the commit

    # Commit two files.
    # Oops. Only meant to commit one.
    git reset --soft HEAD^
    # Puts files back into staged area.
    # Edit files and/or remove one file from staging.
    git reset HEAD file1.txt
    # Recommit
    git commit -a -c ORIG_HEAD
    
or if you merely need to add more files or changes to the previous commit (not removing any files from the set)

    git commit -a --amend

## Revert
Oops. You realize you made a bad commit yesterday, but it's already been shared across other Git repositories.

Revert to a previous commit (via a new commit), but don't commit it until you review what's going to be in this commit. This is similar to a banking transaction in which you fix the old error by a new journal entry, not deleting the mistaken one. This leaves an audit trail. 

    git revert -n

Revert is the better choice in the situation where the previous changes have been pushed to another repository. If they have, `amend` is a bad idea; you are re-writing history. Your remote repository may subsequently deny your amended push if the original was previously pushed.

## Resetting to a Previous State
There are several modes of operation for reset for which the [difference is quite striking. These include soft, hard, mixed, merge, and keep](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reset.html).

* Soft
  * Does not touch the index or working directory
* Hard
  * Discards index and working directory changes
* Mixed
  * Changes the index, but not the working directory (the default behavior)
* Merge
  * Resets index, updates working directory (clean files), keeps untracked changes.
* Keep
  * 2 way merge

Discard any uncommitted changes

    git reset --hard
    
Revert history to two commits ago (discarding them)

    git reset --hard HEAD^^

Move staged files back to unstaged state

    git reset

Restore a single file to its last committed state

    git checkout -- SOMEFILE

Restore a file to a past specified state

    git checkout TREEISH -- SOMEFILE



## Cleaning
Remove untracked files (generally temp, generated, compiled)

    git clean
    
But it will complain that you aren't asking it to actually clean (force, `-f`)

    git clean -f
    
Or preview (`-n` or `--dry-run`) what will be done

    git clean -n
    git clean --dry-run

Or clean directories (`-d`) too (not just files)

    git clean -f -d
    
## Reflog
The `reflog` is the transactional journal of what's been performed on your repository, including `reset`s, `commit`s, `merge`s and `rebase`s. Can be used to identify a treeish to `reset` to (a known `HEAD@{X}` point).

    git reflog
    817c5e7 HEAD@{0}: commit (initial): Adding files

    git reset HEAD@{0}

or

    git merge HEAD@{0}

Reflog entries are [kept for 90 days](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reflog.html). Orphaned entries are kept for 30 days.
