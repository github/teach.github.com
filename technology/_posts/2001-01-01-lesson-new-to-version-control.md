We're glad you're considering learning Git. We also know, from having been in your shoes, that being new to version control can mean there's a lot to digest before a [class with existing VCS knowledge as a pre-requisite](http://github.com/training/online).  We've assembled some materials and links that provide a getting-starting perspective and the motivations behind version control. They form the basis of understanding how Git can be applied to a software development workflow.
