# Authoring Books on GitHub
Git and GitHub are not just for writing programming code. They can also be an effective tool for writing articles and books. Matthew McCullough has written a quick [guide to writing books in lightweight formats](https://github.com/matthewmccullough/bookauthoringhowto). This article will be folded into this Teaching repository over the coming months.

# What is this?
This is a repository of ideas, techniques, tools and tricks on how to write a technical book. It was started by [Matthew McCullough](http://github.com/matthewmccullough), and added to by [Phil Haack](http://github.com/haacked), [Dan Allen](http://github.com/mojavelinux), [Neal Ford](http://github.com/nealford), and [Nate Schutta](http://github.com/ntschutta), and all the committers you'll see in the repo history. I just didn't want to hoard any knowledge that would help inspire others to write a technical book.

# Inspirations
The contents of this repo have been partly invented from colleague conversations at [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com) during the [Gradle book](http://bit.ly/gradlebook1) with [Tim Berglund](http://augusttechnologygroup.com) and [Pearson](http://www.pearsoned.com) during the [Presentation Patterns](http://presentationpatterns.com) book, partly inspired by open source projects, and partly refactored from snippets from colleagues and friends. Many are attributed.
