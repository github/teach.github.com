# W-JAX Git Workshop
2012-11-09

Distributed version control is all the rage these days, but is it worth it? It has been transformative for the dozens of organizations and thousands of developers that I've mentored on the unique implementation called Git. But don't take my word for it. Discover the joy of a version control system that works for you, not against you, in a hands-on workshop. Bring a Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop and we'll install, set up, use and bend Git into workflows that weren't even possible with the version control systems of yesteryear. Be prepared to rethink how lightweight, fast, and refreshing source code control can be. After completing this workshop you'll be able to do practical work with Git for your day job or weekend OSS hobby. Attendees should have pre-installed Git on their laptops.
