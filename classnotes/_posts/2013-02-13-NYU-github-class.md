# NYU

We've heard you have been/are interested in:

* Been adding, committing, pushing, and pulling by incantation for a while.
* Could probably use a deep dive on what those incantations mean.
* Walk through an add/commit cycle, but explain internals as we go.
* Make a branch, merge it.
* Disgram what branches are, where branch files live internally.
* Push repo to GitHub.
* Have second instructor fork, change, issue pull request.
* Merge it.

Other options for the evening include:

* Create conflicts in commits.
* Terrace pull requests.
* Show how issues can be used to track defects.
* Issues auto-closed by commits messages.
* Show continuous integration connected to GitHub with Status API.
* @mentions for conversations
* Text format rendering
* Image diffs
* Reflog
* Rebase
* `git add -p`

Your ideas/questions:

* Branching model
 * Forking model is for "untrusted"
 inbound changes
*  Branching is for "trusted" inbound
 changes
