	Amit T.	Yes, it opens up on a different window than your browser
	technoweenie	Ann: What notes specifically are you referring to?
	Jennifer S.	i got it
	Jennifer D.	what should we use for email configuration ? if we connect to multiple different repos some public some yahoo is there isolation here?
	Bao T.	\
	Jennifer S.	a black window, right?
	technoweenie	yes
	he swaps between slides and his terminal
	Jennifer D.	ie not wanting work email to show up in public repo interaction, yet people being able to know how to contact direct
	or does it even matter?
	technoweenie	Jennifer D: this is where you can setup a different configuration per repo if you want
	8:25 AM

	Tony L.	how do you un-set it?
	technoweenie	git config --global --unset core.autocrlf

	Christopher S.	seems 1.7.5.4 fills the current dir with files on mac
	technoweenie	what files?
	Christopher S.	my mistake, i think i know what these are

	tlberglund	View paste 
	Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
	And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
	8:40 AM
	Sneha M.	no need of ticket?
	Lars A.	lol
	Sneha M.	sorry
	technoweenie	Not every commit needs to reference a ticket
	It may be a good idea with your team's development workflow, but Git doesn't require anything like that
	tlberglund	Eagerly I wished the morrow -- vainly I had sought to borrow
	Jennifer D.	so 'add' is like a staging aspect
	technoweenie	Yes
	you can also do `git commit -am "..."` The -a lets you bypass the step of adding files manually

	David B.	To get colors working in terminal on OS X I needed to:
	View paste

	1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
	 what is the 1 insertion means here?
	Vivek P.	how do you revert back the changes done before commit?
	technoweenie	so with git, you'd normally add every file manually, and make one commit for all the changes
	tlberglund	It works, but it will create bad habits here. :)
	technoweenie	sneha: it means you added a line to the file

	technoweenie	`git revert` will basically commit a reverse of the commit. So if you added a line, reverting it would remove that line
	I think we should wait for Tim to get to this part of the training though
	Christopher S.	can you specify a diff to a certain file?
	Bao T.	yup
	git diff filename
	8:55 AM
	Christopher S.	thought it was simple like that
	technoweenie	yes, you can add the file name after --
	git diff {whatever} -- file.txt
	Sneha M.	--staged
	sorry
	Ann R.	I was taking notes - what is the diff btw $git diff and $git diff --staged?
	technoweenie	Ann: it shows the diff with what you have staged for the next commit
	Ann: after you use `git add` to stage a file for commit, `git diff` won't show anything. You'll have to use `git diff --staged` to show the the diff between what's staged and your most recent commit
	Yes, exactly what Tim is saying now :)
	Sneha M.	how do i see the file on stage and commit
	9:00 AM
	Vivek P.	git add
	Amit T.	git commit
	Bao T.	add again
	technoweenie	I'm actually not sure how to see the content in staging
	Sneha: you want to show the diff between staging and the history, leaving out any changes in the working directory?
	I'm looking around
	Tony L.	I have a raven.txt~ file from emacs... can I make git ignore it?
	Sneha M.	svn shows web view
	Andy R.	What's the difference between diff --stage and --cached?
	Sneha M.	does git has similar to that?
	technoweenie	Andy: those are aliases of each other
	Sneha M.	:)
	Vivek P.	what if i realize one of the commits that i have made is something i did not want to commit?
	Andy R.	:)
	regis c.	how to remove a file that has been staged?
	thanks
	technoweenie	Be very careful with `git reset` and use it *exactly* how git tells you :)
	9:05 AM
	technoweenie	Sneha: Git doesn't have a built-in web view, but there are lots of options
	Philip S.	if you do git add or git commit without specifying the file names, would git pick up all the relevant files recursively from the current directory?
	Adam B.	git add . right?
	Sneha M.	at what time is the session tomorrow? Do we need another registration?
	technoweenie	git commit can use -a
	but it won't commit new files, you always have to add those with `git add`
	Ann R.	I missed the command you entered to get help
	technoweenie	The Git docs are on the web too: http://gitscm.com/docs
	`git help log`
	you can do that with any git command
	Adam B.	how can i conifg to make diff/log etc write to stdout
	technoweenie	is it piping it to less or something?
	Amit T.	collaboration?
	Adam B.	because its distributed, not linear
	Tony L.	multiple users?
	9:10 AM
	Adam B.	and yes to less
	Jens J.	database free?
	Jeff B.	distributed development
	Bao T.	security
	Andy R.	Because each git commit is a snapshot.
	Adam B.	its not critical, but stdout would be nicer
	technoweenie	adam: try adding --no-pager
	Jeff B.	what's the probability of hash collisions?
	Jens J.	CS nerd
	technoweenie	adam: Git has some pager options you can set
	Jeff B.	sorry, but is there a collision resolution mechanism?
	technoweenie	adam: you can turn off the pager for everything with `git config --global core.pager ''`
	Adam B.	did that, and tried system, still piping to less. weird. Nevermind, I'll find the config later
	Ann R.	Do we configure name and email every time that we launch GIT?
	technoweenie	Adam: Check for GIT_PAGER or PAGER env vars
	Ann: nope. Once you set the --global config, it's saved forever on that machine
	Adam B.	PAGER is set to less
	thanks

	tlberglund	As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door
	Chuck S.	Is "re-parenting" a fair synonym for rebasing?
	8:30 AM
	Vivek P.	but isn't not same as HEAD?
	tlberglund	From the ashes a fire shall awaken
	aspires	Chuck: not exactly. You can use rebase to re-parent, but you can do a lot of cool things with rebase. So, it's not a pure synonym
	tlberglund	A light from the shadows will spring
	Vivek P.	does rebase also merge?
	merge happened
	Adam B.	because the tree has changed, so the hash does
	Chuck S.	tree changed
	Vivek P.	and the hash changed
	aspires	Vivek: It's not quite a merge. Rebase actually rewrites history.
	8:35 AM
	aspires	It may look the same, functionally, but it's not identical.

	Amit T.	On a reset, does one lose the local changes too?
	Vivek P.	is it 60 days by default?
	Adam B.	so untracked files are unaffected by a reset?
	Vivek P.	what if i have stashed?
	what if i have stashed?
	aspires	Vivek: It is 60 days by default, but this can be changed
	Vivek P.	okay
	8:50 AM
	aspires	I do `rebase -i` just about every day for the very reason Tim talked about
	9:00 AM
	Ann R.	has left the room
	anwesha	has left the room
	Vivek P.	is this rebasing also known as cherry picking?

	Jennifer D.	this is like super awesome
	you can modify your local set of changes and tidy it all up
	Jens J.	yeah, i didnt see anything like rebase squashing in svn
	aspires	
	Jeff B.	is there a set of best practices somewhere for rebasing and flattening commits?
	9:05 AM
	Adam B.	what about squash v fixup?
	Jennifer D.	so git.corp.yahoo.com or something else?

	oops :)

	Rick B.	yep
	Tony L.	yes
	Vivek P.	yes
	Joe M.	yes
	Chuck S.	Where did "origin" come from?
	tlberglund	https://github.com/githubteacher/poetry
	aspires	Chuck: where did we get the server location, or where did the term "origin" come from?
	9:20 AM
	Jennifer D.	this is the exciting part!
	haha!
	Bao T.	lol
	Chuck S.	What does "origin" represent?
	Is it a reserved word? a name we gave something? a command?
	aspires	Origin is a common term for your main remote server
	but it can be anything
	often people will have several remote servers for a repository, and each can be named something unique
	when you do a git push or a git pull command, it will be oriented at a server
	Tim will go into that a bit more after the break
	9:25 AM
	Chuck S.	thx. I guess I missed the step in which we named it "origin".
	aspires	the command is `git remote add origin https://github.com/githubteacher/poetry.git`
	`add origin` is the naming step
	Chuck S.	thanks for that.

	Chuck S.	aspires: I copied manually and github settings show my public key but I still get perm denied.
	don't worry about it. I'll just listen for now.
	aspires	Chuck -- what happens when you use `ssh -T git@github.com`
	Adam B.	git pull
	Andy R.	git pull
	10:25 AM
	Tony L.	I don't see the new merges after I do a git fetch

	Adam B.	could you rebase the remote commits?
	rather than pull?
	ryan n.	so to push to our remote origin, we need to pull from upstream. then push to origin
	?
	Adam B.	that was what I meant, ok
	Vivek P.	diff between origin and upstream ... i mean what it means?
	10:35 AM
	tlberglund	git remote add upstream git@github.com:githubteacher/poetry.git
	git pull upstream master
	Vivek P.	i got a conflict
	10:40 AM
	Jennifer D.	so when someone does a "pull request"
	who is 'pulling'
	so when you 'pull' you pulled in updates
	so you are a pull requestor when you provide an update
	Tony L.	can there be more than one owner of a repo?
	Andy R.	Can you pls repeat what you said about Y! API example? I lost the network for ~2mins.
	Jennifer D.	I hear people using the terminology and it's a little confusing sometimes.
	Andy R.	OK, thx!
	tlberglund	git clone git@github.com:githubteacher/poetry.git teacher-poetry
	Adam B.	so you meant clone, not fork
	10:45 AM
	Adam B.	could we have just switched out the remotes?
	ryan n.	do we start commiting, and pushing?
	aspires	Adam B: I wouldn't reccomend it
	Jennifer D.	lol. always behind.
	Vivek P.	my changes are in
	Adam B.	ok, thanks
	10:50 AM
	tlberglund	git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
	git config --local branch.master.rebase true
	Maciek W.	has left the room
	Philip S.	on this page: https://github.com/githubteacher/poetry why are some people's checkin associated with their name while others their userid
	Jennifer D.	I love the panderers :)
	tlberglund	Jennifer: Me too!
	10:55 AM
	Adam B.	I think the display name depends on the user.name config we set yesterday
	aspires	Philip: that's generally due to when users don't have their Git config email in https://github.com/settings/emails
	tlberglund	git push -u origin tlberglund
	Philip S.	austin, i think you are right.

	Christopher S.	short qestion
	is there a way to call back what aliases you have made?
	tlberglund	Oh yes.
	git config --list will show them (along with all the other config parameters).
	git config --list | grep alias to filter them
	Christopher S.	cool, thought it would be something simple like that, thanks
	tlberglund	You bet.
	Get meta-lesson: it's always built out of standard parts. :)
	11:10 AM
	Jennifer D.	so the class notes will arrive via email?
	11:15 AM
	tlberglund	Jennifer: Yes.
	I'll compile them this afternoon and Jessica (our training coordinator) will send them to one of your training coordinators (I don't know which :) )
	Jennifer D.	awesome. thanks!
	tlberglund	You betcha. Thanks for all your questions. Makes class 10x more fun for the teacher.
	Perhaps 11x.
	11:20 AM
	Christopher S.	another questions, less short: will git commit the contents of a symlink or the target files contents ?
