## Q&A Transcript

### Day 1

**Why didn't the first push work when your credential cache was on?**  
He had a different set of credentials cached! whoops.

**Will `blame -C` give us weird answers for very common lines such as 
`int i;` or `#include "attr.h"`?**  
If we tune the `-C` with an integer like `-C9` or `-C80` we can fine 
tune to watch for those copies a bit harder or softer.

**How can I see what branches are available?  `git status` shows 
current branch, how do I know what other branches there are?**  
Great question! A way to see this would be: `git branch`. If you want 
to see all branches (even remotes that your repository knows about) 
you can use: `git branch -a` to see all of them.

**So it's possible to have multiple remote repo locations per local repo? 
Not sure if that's the right terminology.**  
Perfect terminology. I have some projects that actually have three remote 
repos. Depending on if I have a "fork" of a repository (fork's are something 
we'll chat on later for sure), I could have two origins that even live on 
GitHub: origin for my fork, and the project my fork came from. Lastly, if 
I want to update to heroku.com, I can set a remote to there as well. This 
should all become more and more clear as we interact with GitHub more 
often! Let me know if you want me to continue to clarify.

**If you accidentally commit a sensitive file is there a way to remove both 
file and history to ensure it can't be brought back?**  
This can be a tricky situation! **If we haven't pushed to our remote** we can 
reset this commit. If in this situation we added the passwords/sensitive 
information in our last commit, we can use `git reset`. With git reset, 
we can actually say "ok ok, undo those commits and pretend they never 
happened" and we actually undo those commits from history. The command to 
actually do this (with the previous commit) is: `git reset --hard HEAD^`. 
The `HEAD^` part just says "the most recent commit". We can scoot back a 
number of commits with the `HEAD~4` where 4 is the number of commits to 
jump back. Let me know if I can specify this further, but we'll definitely 
be touching on this in this class!

**Is there a CLI for pull requests?**  
You can install a gem then "hub pull-request" on a branch. 
The one I use is "hub".

**If you cherry pick in a change will Git recognize the history in blame?**  
Yep, cherry-pick will result in the same thing.

**Can you please confirm that "origin" means destination on the server?**  
Yep! It's essentially just a keyword or bookmark for a specific URL. We can 
confirm this with: `git remote -v` and see that it's really a shorthand for 
the URL to github.com

**Is forking on the CLI preferred?**  
It's all about preferences! I personally use github.com, Matthew uses 
a hub gem to do his forking and pull requests. Details about which can 
be found here: https://github.com/defunkt/hub

### Day 2

**Why would you want this? I get a "clean" graph, but doesn't it confuse 
the 'history'?**  
Essentially it can just allow a cleaner history. This can be useful when 
we want to undo some commits. As Matthew is showing with that graph, we 
can easily undo commits and understand the order at which things have 
come into the repo.

**Do you have any recommendation or best practice in terms of when to use 
merge and when to use rebase?**  
It really depends on what you're looking for: Clean history with the 
ability to more easily go back to a safer point... or see where 
commits/branches were merged into a branch (like master). 
Each has pros and cons and is basically up to you =)

**For those planning to use  Git in a corporate environment (non-public 
repos with 24/7  connectivity), how best would one use the combination 
of branching _and_ cloning to support parallel development, integration, and 
software release?  In other words, is there a better model other than 
having a single canonical (archive) repo and individual "sandbox" repos?**  
Personally, I've just had my own separate branches depending on what I'm 
working on, and send those pull requests into the same repo. Pretend 
for just a moment that our "contention" repository is private and we're all 
on a software team. As I create some feature, I'd call it 
"brentbeer-feature134" and create some changes. I could then send a pull 
request from "githubtrainer/master" from "githubtrainer/brentbeer-feature134". 
And we have an internal pull request from branch-to-branch within the same 
[private] repo. Hope that makes sense!

**Can you show us an example of a merge conflict, and the best practice 
for resolving it?**  
A reminder that when the pull-request is not automatically mergeable, 
there's an (i) that can show you how to merge it locally and update it!

**Can "remote" be seen as the place where "staging" (from yesterday) 
happens, in the most recent picture that was shown**  
It's more of a local "browser" cache from the upstream.

**Does rebasing mitigate the contention problem or just make for a 
simpler graph?**   
Hopefully it allows you to save yourself later if a problem were to arrive. 
It's easier to reset and fix a problem after a rebase was done. 
It also makes for a nice, easy-to-follow graph.

**Is the ability to automatically merge strictly checking if a merge is a 
fast forward, or if it's not a fast forward is a test merge performed 
somewhere?**  
Nope. The reason it doesn't merge is because of the conflict Matthew just 
demonstrated. The fast-forward vs non-fast-forward has no effect on if a 
pull request can be automatically merged from the interface. Because of 
multiple "merge strategies", github.com will act like the command line will.

**Does "cannot be automatically merged" necessarily imply conflict?**  
Yep, it does.

**Your previous revert example was a surgical removal of that 
point, rather than reverting TO that point**  
Revert is simply a reversal of a previous commit. If we noticed an entire 
commit was wrong, we could create a new commit to completely reverse it 
and record that we reversed it.

**We all make mistakes. Can you show us some ways to undo blunders 
(git force notwithstanding!) ... or perhaps suggest some exercises 
to avoid future problems?**  
`git revert`! It's a super great way to undo some commits while 
maintaining that you've actually undone it. Reset removes it from history.

**How would we do the pull request from our command line?**  
You can view the https://github.com/defunkt/hub repo if you would like 
to read more about it.

**For development / integration / deployment, branches seem to be an 
obvious architecture. Could you speak to other possibilities you find 
yourself using, such as separate repositories?**  
Branches are absolutely great for forming your different changes/features/etc 
in a project in a structured way. Separate repositories can actually be 
used inside of a current repository, these are often called "submodules" 
and are quite a tricky subject!

**Is it true that a rebase never resolves conflicts?**  
The idea, to me, is that rebase may save you from some 
contention down the line, but it won't solve the conflicts for you.

**How can I remove a remote named 'official' after setting it with a 
bad or the wrong URL?**  
`git remote remove official`

**What is the tool for merging?**  
It's just called "mergetool". You can look at this command with: 
`git help mergetool`

**So this provides a cleaner commit history but doesn't reduce 
contentions, right? I still get "tip of your current branch is behind" 
when trying to push.**  
It really adds the ability to mitigate contentions if they happened. 
If there had been a bad commit that we merged in instead of rebasing it 
may be harder to reset.

**Can we view this on GitHub itself?**  
Absolutely! https://github.com/githubtrainer/contention/network 
shows these commits from different authors.

**How can we see the graph?**  
We can fire up "gitk &" as well to view locally.

**Is there a git hook to refuse these merges on main repo?**
